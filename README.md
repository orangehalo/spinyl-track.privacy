# Privacy Policy for Spinyl Track

**Last Updated: December 14, 2025**

## Introduction

Spinyl Track ("we", "our", or "the app") is a vinyl record tracking application available for iOS and Android. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

- **Listening History**: When you scan vinyl records and log listens, this data is stored locally on your device. This includes album names, artist names, listen dates, and any notes you add.

- **Discogs Account Authentication**: To access album and artist information, the app requires you to authenticate with your Discogs account using OAuth. We do not store your Discogs password. The app only stores authentication tokens necessary to make API requests on your behalf.

### Information We Do NOT Collect

- We do **not** collect personal information such as your name, email address, or location
- We do **not** track your usage or behavior within the app
- We do **not** use analytics or tracking services
- We do **not** display advertisements
- We do **not** transmit your listening history to any external servers

## Data Storage

All your listening data is stored **locally on your device only**. This means:

- Your data remains private and under your control
- If you uninstall the app, your data will be deleted
- We have no access to your listening history or personal data

## Third-Party Services

### Discogs API

The app uses the [Discogs API](https://www.discogs.com/developers) to:

- Search for album information when you scan barcodes
- Retrieve album artwork, artist images, and release details
- Access your Discogs account to authenticate API requests

When you connect your Discogs account, you are subject to [Discogs' Privacy Policy](https://www.discogs.com/privacy). We only request the minimum permissions necessary to search the Discogs database.

### Image Services

Album artwork and artist images are retrieved from Discogs' servers. No images are uploaded from your device.

## Your Rights and Choices

You have full control over your data:

- **View Your Data**: All your listening history is visible within the app
- **Delete Individual Items**: Swipe to delete individual listens, albums, or artists
- **Delete by Year**: Remove all listens from a specific year via the Profile tab
- **Delete All Data**: Completely clear all your data via the Profile tab
- **Disconnect Discogs**: You can revoke the app's access to your Discogs account at any time through your [Discogs application settings](https://www.discogs.com/settings/applications)

## Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information:

- Authentication tokens are stored securely using platform-native encrypted storage (iOS Keychain / Android EncryptedSharedPreferences)
- All communication with Discogs uses HTTPS encryption
- Your listening data never leaves your device

## Children's Privacy

Spinyl Track is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Your continued use of the app after any changes indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.
